## About these Workshops

Basic TrAIning is a series of three workshops developed in partnership with Capital One to teach Python skills for Artificial Intelligence use cases.

## Part III: Use Your Data in a Bot!

In the third workshop in this series, participants will feed their data into a Markov chain bot. They will compare the quality of responses from data scraped from Twitter (a small data set) to data retrieved using the Twitter API (a larger data set). At the end of the series, participants will have a fully functional, deployed Markov chain bot of the celebrity of their choice!

## Requirements / Prerequisites

No special software is necessary. Computers that can connect to the internet are all that’s required!

**System Requirements**:
* The latest version of Google Chrome is the preferred browser for this workshop, but it’s not required.
