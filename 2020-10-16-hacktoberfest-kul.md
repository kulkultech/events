# Event Description

Kulkul Tech Workshop is a series of online events organized by Kulkul Technology (PT Kulkul Teknologi Internasional) a company that provides software development consulting and training to companies and software engineers. Since its inception, we regularly held online meetups and workshops. In this awesome Hacktober, we will join forces with Hacktoberfest, a globally organized event aiming to global software developers to contribute openly to open-source software. In Kulkul we use a lot of open-source software and this event is one of the ways for us to give back and encourage the next level of engineers.

In this event, we will bring the master itself [Arjuna Sky Kok][ARJUNA] the author of Hands-On Blockchain for Python Developers and also the Founder of [Predict Salary](https://predictsalary.com/) who will encourage our audience in the Browser Extension Development. As a complement, we from Kulkul will also launch our Open Source software that opens for Hacktoberfest contribution. So don't wait, let's join our event today by RSVP-ing on our meetup page.

To make this event more interesting we'll also give a free 2 hour mentoring from Mentor in Kulkul for the participants who contribute to our open-source software. So let's join us!
