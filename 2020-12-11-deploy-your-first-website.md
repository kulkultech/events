# Guide from MLH
## About this Workshop

During this workshop, you’ll teach participants the structure and syntax of basic HTML and CSS. Participants will receive a skeleton of a portfolio website and will update the HTML to include information about themselves and edit the CSS to style and position elements on their page! Then, they’ll deploy their new website.

## HTML & CSS

HTML is the skeleton of every website on the internet and nearly all websites use CSS for styling. Learning HTML and CSS is the first step toward building a personal website, becoming more technically fluent, or beginning a career in web development or design!

## Deployment

While learning to edit HTML elements and CSS properties is an important first step toward making a website, there are more steps to getting a website publicly available on the internet. In this workshop, participants will use a simple deployment tool to get their website live before they leave!

# Requirements / Prerequisites

Participants will be required to have a computer that can connect to the Internet and run the following software:

System Requirements:

* MacOS, Linux, or Windows 8 or higher

This workshop is designed for absolute beginners! There are no prerequisites.

## Intro to HTML + Q&A

In this section the speaker would present a gentle and hands-on introduction to HTML. Things like semantic HTML and the DOM will be discussed here. In this section we will introduce how HTML acts as the foundational structure of the document in the world wide web.

## Intro to CSS + Q&A

In this section, our speaker would present a gentle introduction to the CSS and how it complements the HTML as the aesthetic element of the document in the world wide web. If the HTML is the wall, window, and a ceiling of a house, CSS would be the painting or ceramics that make the house more aesthetic.
